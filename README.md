# Hangman
Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.

This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it.

## Description

This project is a simple Python program that demonstrates several concepts, including working with lists, random word selection, and user input validation. The main aim of the project is to create an interactive game where the user guesses a word randomly selected from a list of favorite fruits.

By following this project, you will learn how to:

- Create and manipulate Python lists.
- Use the `random` module to select random elements from a list.
- Take user input and validate it to ensure it meets specific criteria.

## Installation

## Description

The "Milestone 3: Random Word Guessing Game" project is a Python program that combines a random word guessing game with user input validation. The project aims to create an interactive game where the user guesses a letter from a randomly selected word and provides immediate feedback on the correctness of the guess.

This project demonstrates several important concepts, including:

- Input validation to ensure users provide valid input.
- Checking whether the user's guess is in the secret word.
- Using functions to modularize and organize code.

By following this project, you will learn how to enhance code readability and maintainability by breaking it into functions, as well as how to validate user input and provide real-time feedback.
